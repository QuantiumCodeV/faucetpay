We do not guarantee the identity of any recipient, user, requestee or other party. You cannot reverse a Virtual Currency Transaction once it has been broadcast to the relevant Virtual Currency network. If a Virtual Currency Transaction has not yet been confirmed on the Virtual Currency network, Virtual Currency associated with such transaction will be designated as pending and will not be included in your Virtual Currency wallet balance or be available to conduct Virtual Currency Transactions. You cannot reverse or change any Virtual Currency Transaction marked as complete or pending. You must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, licensing requirements and third party rights (including, without limitation, data privacy laws) in your use of the Services. We may refuse to process or cancel any pending Virtual Currency Transaction as required by law or any court or other authority to which we are subject in any jurisdiction. We further reserve the right to delay any Virtual Currency Transaction if we perceive a risk of fraud or illegal activity. We also have the right to refuse to process or cancel any Virtual Currency Transaction due to technological issues with the blockchain software, our own software, or for other technological reasons. Our Services are available only in connection with those virtual currencies that we support which may change from time to time. A full list of the virtual currencies we currently support can be found on the Website at Supported Coins.

We assume no responsibility or liability in connection with any attempt to use your Account or virtual currency wallet for virtual currencies that we do not support. 3 You acknowledge that: (i) FaucetPay is not a bank or brokerage and the Services provided are facilitation services rather than banking services; and (ii) FaucetPay is not acting as a trustee, fiduciary or escrow with respect to your virtual currency or funds, but is acting only as a Service provider.
